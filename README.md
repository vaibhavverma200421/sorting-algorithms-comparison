Python comparison of Bubble, Insertion, and Selection Sort runtimes



# 游빍 Sorting Algorithms Runtime Comparison

This Python project compares the execution times of three basic sorting algorithms:

- 游댯 Bubble Sort
- 游릭 Insertion Sort
- 游리 Selection Sort

It uses randomly generated lists of integers and measures the time taken by each sorting method.

## 游늬 Project Overview

The script does the following:

1. Generates a random list of integers.
2. Duplicates the list for a fair comparison across algorithms.
3. Runs each sorting algorithm on its own copy.
4. Measures and prints the time each algorithm takes.

## 游닆 Sorting Algorithms Included

### 游댯 Bubble Sort

Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### 游릭 Insertion Sort

Builds the sorted list one item at a time by comparing and inserting elements into their correct position.

### 游리 Selection Sort

Finds the minimum element and places it at the beginning. Repeats for all positions.
